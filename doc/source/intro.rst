Introduction
============

This is a library for interfacing with the `Titan Microelectronics`_ `TM1640`_ 16-digit 7-segment display controller.

This was based on the `Arduino version`_ written by Ricardo Batista.  It was `originally ported to Raspberry Pi`_ by FuryFire.  Forked off into a seperate project with lots of work done on it by Michael Farrell.

As this is based on code from the original Arduino library, it is licensed under the GPLv3.
