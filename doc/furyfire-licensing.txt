RPi TM1640 licensing (direct message)

Hi,
I've done a bunch of work on your RPi TM1640 display driver code, and forked it off into a separate repository of my own.

I've cleaned up some of the code and build infrastructure, added some new features, made it a library (and adapted your existing command-line tool to work with the library), and added Python bindings.

However now as I actually want to release that again, I need to clarify the licensing with you of the original project, as you have not explicitly specified it.

My thought is as your work is a derivative of the Arduino TM16xx library, which is licensed under the GPLv3, this would make your project also licensed under the GPLv3 even if you have not explicitly written this.

You have other code in your raspi repository that is licensed under the GPLv2 and GPLv3, which would lead me to make a reasonable assumption that this is something you would be happy with.

Can you please confirm this?

If I don't hear from you, I will follow through with the assumption that the RPi TM1640 display driver is a derivative of the Arduino version, and thus GPLv3, and release my modified version under the same terms.

Thanks,


Michael

You're free to do whatever you want with the code.

And you're right it's a derivative of the Arduino TM16xx project so would be natural to keep it as GPLv3.

My only tiny request is that you maintain the affiliation link for the product page on http://dx.com

But you're of course free to do what you want - I take no ownership of the code.

I'll be happy to see the end result!
